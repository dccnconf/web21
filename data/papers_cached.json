    "abstract": "V2X system support a large number of new services and protocols, therefore,  moving to integrated interaction with the surrounding information space, defined as V2X interoperability, should ensure the interoperability of the various networks and systems involved in providing services to users[5]. The data must be transmitted with low latency and high speed between vehicles. This requires the introduction of a new high-speed network, advanced road transport, and telecommunications infrastructure. To ensure the effective functioning of V2X networks,  in this paper we propose to use flying fog computing for a reliable and efficient system for simulation model, we used a UAVs as a base station (BS) equipped by a controller (CU) that provide execution of the requests arriving from the users equipment located in the communication range of the BS. Users that are connected with the BS requests flow that arrive at CU, we assume that one cloud server (CS) can serve a number of UAVs. CU is described as a service system which provides execution of some requests simultaneously. We assume that the execution of each request flow from users needs a fixed amount of energy. We\u2019ve noticed that in the case of low traffic intensity the delay value increases with increasing of the part of traffic forwarded to the cloud, the energy consumption lower if the part of redirected traffic is bigger",

    "abstract": "We consider a two server queueing inventory model with two types of customers. Type-I customers can form an infinite queue, while type-II customers join a finite buffer of size N. There are two servers.  Server-1 is a dedicated server, giving service only to the type-I customers. Server-2 provides service to both type-I and type-II customers.  Service of each customer requires an inventory item. Type-I customers are served one by one, by both servers on a FIFO basis. Type-II customers are served in batches of varying sizes by server-2. A random clock is set for type-II customers, which starts ticking with the arrival of first type-II customer to an empty buffer.  When the number of type-II customers becomes N or when the random clock realizes, server-2 starts the service of that batch of type-II customers. In such a situation, if server-2 is giving service to a type-I customer, its service is frozen and the service of that batch of type-II begins.  The arrival of both types of customers are according to a stationary Marked Markovian Arrival Process. The service times of both type-I and type-II customers follow phase type distribution. The inventory replenishment follows the  (s,S) policy with positive leadtime. If the required inventory is not there at the time of service of a batch of type-II customers, local purchase is done.",

Arrivals of customers in batches of various sizes (1,2,...,k ) form a marked compound Poisson process; we designate the batches as T1,T2,...,Tk. The service time of  Ti follows exponential distribution with parameter mu i, i=1,2,...,k; they are served in batches of the specific size. In arrival process, waiting room of type i for Ti has finite capacity except waiting room of type  1 for T1. In service process, server room of type i has finite capacity. Ti can go to service if server room of type i has available space. If server room of type i does not have available place, then there are two following cases. The first case, if waiting room of type i has available places, Ti must wait in this waiting room. The second case, if waiting room of type i  does not have available place, then Ti must leave the system without service except T1, who must wait in waiting room of type 1.

Packets arrive according to a Markovian arrival process to a multi server station. An arriving packet is suspected to be malicious with a probability p or transmitted with the complimentary probability 1 - p: A suspected packet is sent to an observation pool. When a packet reaches the pool, two random clocks starts ticking. One\r\nof the random clocks shows Erlang distributed times, this is the duration of observation . The second clock on realization gives the duration for generating the status of being malware affected or not and this clock gives Coxian distributed times. A packet gets transmitted from pool upon realization of the Erlang clock, provided the Coxian clock does not realize until this point of time. If the Coaxian clock realizes \frst, then the packet is assumed to be malware infected and it is sent to a multi server station for the recovery and then transmitted after the recovery process. This system is modeled as a continuous time Markov chain and is analyzed using matrix analytic method. The model is illustrated numerically.",

Customers and breakdowns arrive to the main server according to Markovian arrival processes (MAP). If at the moment of a customer arrival the main server is busy, then the customer goes to the orbit. If at the moment of a primary or an orbital customer arrival the main server is under repair and the backup server is free,\r\nthen the customer goes to the backup server. If during the service by the backup server the main server restores, the customer goes to this server and is serviced as a new. If at the time of the arrival of a primary or an orbital customer the main server is under repair and the backup one is busy, then the customer goes to orbit. If a breakdown arrives at the busy main server, then the under-served customer is transferred to the backup server and is serviced as a new. Service times and repair times have phase type (PH) distributions. The system under consideration can be used when modeling the hybrid communication system consisting of the main optic channel and the reserve radio channel. We investigate the stable operation of the system, calculate the stationary distribution and a number of performance measures. We also present illustrative numerical examples to show the behavior of the performance measures of the system.",

The last-mentioned process divided by the large number of customers is a continuous stochastic process with the Markov property.

This is a plausible situation for real complex networks. The evolution of the network in time starting from a seed set of nodes is provided by  linear preferential attachment schemes. We compare the spreading rate of nodes which share their messages with other nodes when they belong to different subgraphs of the non-homogeneous network. It is found that the nodes of the subgraph with the most heavy tailed out-degree distribution may spread their messages faster. We compared the spreading capacity of the linear preferential attachment used also for the graph evolution with a well-known SPREAD algorithm and found that the latter can disseminate the information faster.",

However, it is possible to obtain some signal (information) associated with a semi-Markov process. In this case, the states of the semi-Markov model can be considered hidden (unobservable). There are problems of correcting the model, predicting the states of the simulated information system and analyzing its dynamics on the basis of the received vector of signals. To solve these problems, you can use the apparatus of the theory of hidden Markov models. In this paper, a hidden Markov model of the control system is constructed on the basis of the semi-Markov model of the control system for latent failures of a technological cell. The hidden Markov model is used to assess the characteristics of the control system and predict its states based on the received signal vector. The constructed hidden Markov model makes it possible to expand the possibilities the used semi-Markov model application.",

    "abstract": "We consider a single server multi-class retrial system.  The arrival customer, who meets the server busy, joins the corresponding orbit and then retries to capture the server.  The model obeys to the classical retrial policy: the total rate of orbit customers depends on their number. Retrial times are assumed to be generally distributed, and that makes the analysis much more complicated.    \r\n\r\nWe use the previous results for the systems with exponential retrials and regenerative approach to establish the sufficient stability conditions to the  model under consideration. The key element of the proof relies on Lorden's inequality, which is a the significant  result from the renewal theory.",

    "title": "Availability factor analysis of a network in mesh structure",
    "abstract": "The development of network technologies leads to the introduction of data transmission systems in all areas of human activity. Problems cover large areas with reliable networks, intellectualizing devices for receiving and transmitting data, increasing the speed, quality, and spectrum of transmitted information. Requirements for the given characteristics of the reliability of networks are among the most promising and essential tasks since the cost of equipment, service life, and network maintenance strategy depend on this. Analytical and simulation models play an essential role in determining the reliability characteristics; mathematical apparatus and programming become an inevitable factor in a successful project. This paper presents a methodology and an example of calculating the reliability of networks in a mesh topology.",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with a finite-source queueing system serving one class of customers and consisting of heterogeneous servers with unequal service intensities and  of  one  common  queue.   The  main  model  has  a  non-preemptive  service when  the  customer  can  not  change  the  server  during  its  service  time.   The optimal allocation problem is formulated as a Markov-decision one.  We show numerically  that  the  optimal  policy  which  minimizes  the  long-run  average number of customers in the system has a threshold structure.  We derive the matrix expressions for the mean performance measures and compare the main model with alternative simplified queuing systems which are analysed for the arbitrary number of servers.  We observe that the preemptive heterogeneous model operating under a threshold policy is a good approximation for the main model by calculating the mean number of customers in the system.  Moreover,using the preemptive and non-preemptive queueing models with the faster server first policy the lower and upper bounds are calculated for this mean value",

    "abstract": "The paper deals with the issues of formal veri\fcation of machine learning systems. With the growth of the introduction of systems based on machine learning in the so-called critical systems (systems with a very high cost of erroneous decisions and actions), the demand for con\frmation of the stability of such systems is growing. How will the built machine learning system perform on data that is di\u000berent from the set on which it was trained? Is it possible to somehow verify or even prove that the behavior of the system, which was demonstrated on the initial dataset, will always remain so? There are di\u000berent ways to try to do this. This article deals with the formal veri\fcation of machine learning systems.",

The\r\nproposed algorithm detects features of the contour pixels of objects in a binary\r\nimage, which are further used for pattern recognition. After using the newly\r\ngenerated feature vectors for training a support vector machine (SVM) classifier,\r\nthe speed of processing and classifying objects of interest on an image with a\r\nsize of 1280 \u00d7 720 pixels increased by 3.5 times, in comparison with using the\r\nclassical HOG descriptor.",

    "title": "Targeted massive incident notification system for a globally distributed computation network",
    "abstract": "A typical 'cloud' service, provided by means of a globally distributed computations network commonly has availability SLA below 100%, meaning a possibility of an incident with service outage or service degradation. With a multi-service approach and global segmentation, this incident in most cases does not happen for the whole system and all services at the same time. On the contrary, there are multiple incidents in different global regions and different services, each affecting only subset of customers. An incident notification to all customers creates a negative service provider image in terms of service availability. A targeted incident notification system is introduced in this paper, sending an incident notification to customers who are currently experiencing service outage or degradation only. An implementation of this system in RingCentral, a global 'cloud' telecommunications service provider is given.",

    "abstract": "Although machine learning by its nature, has been resource-intensive, mul- tiple resource efficient alternative approaches have been made in the field of embedded systems. Researchers over the years, have specially shown interest and thus it has fueled the research output, in the field of autonomous naviga- tion, IoT and distributed embedded systems. These approaches are aimed at finding a trade-off between performance and resource consumption in terms of computational costs and energy efficiency. The development of appropriate algorithms is one of the main tasks of modern research in the field of machine learning and the key to ensuring smooth adaptation of machine learning tech- nologies in an environment with limited or distributed computing resources. These algorithms can be divided into four non-mutually exclusive categories: quantization of neural networks, network pruning, structural efficient algorithms, binarized neural networks. Our approach is proposed for working with binary images and extracting binary features for training neural networks This approach provides the possibility of an implementation based on the architecture of a reconfigurable computing systems. Our approach was used to build a neural network architecture. The resulting architecture was trained and tested on the MNIST dataset. The results were compared with the results of the LeNet-5 architecture.",

    "title": "The Importance of Conference Proceedings in Research Evaluation: a Methodology for Assessing Conference Impact",
    "abstract": "Conferences are an essential tool for scientific communication. In disciplines such as Computer Science the majority of original research results are published in conference proceedings. In this study, we have analyzed the role of conference proceedings in various disciplines and propose an alternative approach to research evaluation based on conference proceedings sources indexed in Scopus and Scimago Journal Rank (SJR). This allows one to categorize conference proceedings in quartiles Q1 - Q4 by analogy with SJR journal quartiles. Out of 171 conference proceedings sources analyzed, 38 conference proceedings in Engineering (45% of the list) and 23 in Computer Science (32% of the list) have an SJR level corresponding to the first quartile journals in these areas, which emphasizes the exceptional importance of conferences in these disciplines. The comparison of this bibliometric-driven ranking with the expert-driven CORE ranking in Computer Science showed a 62% overlap, as well as a significant average rank correlation of the category distribution.",

For this purpose, the MIT-BIH Physionet database was used, which contains five classes of different types of cardiac rhythm. We propose an electrocardiogram classifier model, which is an ensemble of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent  deep neural networks with LSTM unit. The results of performed computer experiments show that the proposed model successfully classifies cardiac arrhythmia with an overall accuracy of 99.37%. The computer system developed can be efficient to detect cardiac arrhythmia at an early stage.",

The simulation requires a huge number of parameters to be found, and they all require a large number of simulation runs, where each run takes a different combination of design parameters as input. Computer simulations tend to be expensive. Research that requires a large number of computer calculations will lead to exorbitant computational costs, which will make them practically impracticable. This is what surrogate modeling is for.\r\nSurrogate modeling builds a statistical model to accurately approximate the simulation result. Subsequently, this trained model can replace the original computer simulation when performing system analysis.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, machine learning algorithms are widely used in many intelligent systems. As a result, the development of high-performance, power-efficient, flexible and reliable computing devices is becoming a major challenge. This is especially important for autonomous and mobile systems that use several different machine learning algorithms at the same time. Reconfigurable hardware accelerators are one possible solution to the problem. A key feature of these accelerators is the ability to be dynamically configured by external configuration signal to implement a required at the moment neural network model. In this paper reconfigurable accelerators based on the concept of reconfigurable homogeneous computing environments are proposed. Benefits of the reconfigurability and the usage of reconfigurable environments are discussed. Possible models of a computing environment and its elements, simulation results and their comparison with a classical non-reconfigurable solution are presented.",

    "abstract": "First, a mechanical model of a mechanism with two links of variable length\r\nin space with holonomic constraints is considered. Its mathematical model is\r\nobtained, in the form of Lagrange equations of the second kind. Then we consider\r\na model similar in structure - the number and design of links with a nonholonomic\r\nconstraint in the form of a skier-snowboarder. The mathematical model of a\r\nsystem of rigid bodies with a nonholonomic constraint is based on the Routh\r\ndi\u000berential equations for a nonholonomic system in generalized coordinates\r\nwith Lagrange multipliers. A method is developed for constructing di\u000berential\r\nequations for a system containing nonholonomic constraints using Lagrange\r\nequations of the second kind for a model of a similar structure with holonomic\r\nconstraints. As an example, the model is applied to the description of a skiersnowboarder\r\nwith two variable-length movable links on one ski. Usually, the\r\ncontrol of such systems is implemented on the basis of the method of stabilizing\r\nlinks, however, this article declares methods for controlling mechanical systems\r\nbased on arti\fcial intelligence systems and outlines approaches to their use in\r\nmodels with nonholonomic links.",
