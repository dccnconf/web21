title: "Towards 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks"
---
The Sixth-Generation (6G) technology will revolutionize the wireless ecosystem by offering 
futuristic services to a wide range of advanced devices through underwater, terrestrial, 
and non-terrestrial transmissions. 
Recently, the Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) is growing in importance owing to its capability to deliver services anywhere and anytime. One of the main NTN features is to provide coverage in places that are impossible to reach with any conventional Terrestrial Network (TN).
It is essential to integrate NTNs and TNs into a unified wireless system. The talk will introduce the concept of non-terrestrial networking, review 3GPP NTN features and discuss their potential in satisfying user expectations in 5G-Beyond  and upcoming 6G networks. 
State of the art, current research activities, and open issues will be described to highlight the importance of NTN in next-generation wireless communication networks.
