title: "Performance Analysis of DRX Mechanism in LTE-A Networks using Markov Modeling"
---
In recent years, smartphones have emerged as the basic commodity for the young generation. 
In todayâ€™s time, one of the major constraints for the smartphone users is short battery life, due to various features such as many applications running at the background, large display screen and high data rates. 
For the current generation, the network Long Term Evolution/Long Term Evolution-Advanced (LTE/LTE-A) introduced by Third Generation Partnership Project(3GPP), a power saving mechanism known as Discontinuous Reception (DRX) mechanism has been launched. 
Power saving and Quality of Service (QoS) are the two significant aspects of LTE-A networks. 
DRX is a mechanism, commonly exercised to enhance the power saving competency of a User Equipment (UE) in LTE-A networks. 
In this talk, based on the kind of traffic running at the UE, a new appliance will be discussed to switch the DRX mechanism from the power active state to the power saving state and vice versa. 
This talk will investigate this switching technique in DRX mechanism using the M[X]/G/1 vacation queue system with N-policy. 
The optimal value of N as well as the maximum number of DRX cycles, are computed to obtain the minimal amount of power consumption. 
This study concludes the selection guidelines for choosing the optimal values of N and the maximum number of DRX cycles.
