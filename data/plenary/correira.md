title: "Bridging 5G to 6G Networks: Problems and Challenges"
---
The talk addresses the problems left open in mobile and wireless communications by the implementation of 5G that should be addressed in 6G design.
A brief perspective on the evolution of networks is provided, together with a parallel to the evolution of other technologies. 
The virtualisation of networks needs to be taken to a next level, by properly exploring services differentiation and usersâ€™ behaviour. 
The cloudification of networks needs to be further explored, by properly exploring all its distributed levels and by taking into consideration private as well as body area networks.  
Constraints coming from servicers, such as maximum latency, and from physical implementation, such as bandwidth, are also taken into consideration.  
Conclusions are presented at the end.
